## Routes and Functionality

    Home Page ("/"):
        Renders index.html.

    Basic Form Page ("/first"):
        Renders basic.html.

    Save Form Data ("/save_form_data"):
        Method: POST
        Receives JSON data, stores it in lists, and writes it to basic.json.

    Main Form Page ("/second"):
        Renders mainform.html.

    Submit Form Data ("/submit_form"):
        Method: POST
        Receives form data, stores it in db.json.

    Generate Timetable ("/table"):
        Renders table.html with the generated timetable based on form data.

## Functions
split_hours(start_time, total_hours)

    Splits the given start time into hourly intervals based on the total hours.
    Parameters:
        start_time (str): The starting time in '%H:%M' format.
        total_hours (int): The total number of hours to split.
    Returns: A list of time ranges.

replace_same_teacher(teachers, current_teacher)

    Replaces a teacher with a different one to avoid consecutive slots being the same.
    Parameters:
        teachers (list): A list of available teachers.
        current_teacher (str): The current teacher to be replaced.
    Returns: A new teacher.

## Data Handling

    JSON Operations: Reads from and writes to basic.json and db.json for persistent storage.
    Data Conversion: Converts form data into a structured format suitable for timetable generation.
    Timetable Generation: Uses pandas to create a DataFrame, populates it with teacher schedules, and converts it to an HTML table.

## Example Usage

    Navigate to the Home Page:
        Access the basic form and main form pages from the home page.

    Submit Basic Form Data:
        Input start times, total hours, and days, then save the data.

    Submit Detailed Form Data:
        Input class and teacher details, then submit the form data.

    View Generated Timetable:
        View the dynamically generated timetable on the table page, with editable cells.
